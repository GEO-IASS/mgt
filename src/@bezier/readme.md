Bezier Curves
=============

A matlab class for handling n-dimentional bezier curves, parametrized by control points. 
The main operations are 
- `bezier.eval` evaluate the curve at many points
- `bezier.draw` draw the curve in a image or volume
- `bezier.view` visualize 2D or 3D bezier curves (even multiple curves in the same figure)
- `bezier.explore` explore 2D bezier curves interactively

Run `bezier.test` for analysis and examples.
